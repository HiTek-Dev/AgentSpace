<objective>
Synthesize the completed Phase 18 research into actionable recommendations for Phase 15 (Init & Onboarding Polish) and Phase 16 (Agent Personality System), and finalize the roadmap entry.

Purpose: The research file (18-RESEARCH.md) contains raw findings. Downstream planners need a concise, decision-ready document that maps findings to specific implementation actions — not a second research paper.

Output: 18-RECOMMENDATIONS.md (implementation guidance) + updated ROADMAP.md (Phase 18 goal/plans finalized)

  <name>Task 1: Create 18-RECOMMENDATIONS.md with implementation guidance</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/18-onboarding-research/18-RECOMMENDATIONS.md</files>
  <action>
Read 18-RESEARCH.md and create 18-RECOMMENDATIONS.md with these sections:

## For Phase 15: Init & Onboarding Polish

Concrete implementation actions derived from research:
1. **Two-phase onboarding** — Infrastructure wizard (existing `tek init`) handles keys/gateway/security. Add a final "Hatch" step that starts a mini conversational session where the agent asks personality questions. If skipped, create BOOTSTRAP.md that triggers on first `tek chat`.
2. **Personality presets** — Add 5 presets to onboarding: Professional, Friendly, Technical, Opinionated, Custom. Each preset is a markdown template file in `memory-files/presets/`. Preset selection happens during the Hatch step or BOOTSTRAP.md flow.
3. **Agent naming** — Ask "What should your agent be called?" (default: "tek") and "How should the agent address you?" (default: first name from config). Store in config, inject into system prompt.
4. **Skippable re-run** — `tek init` when already configured shows current values and lets user skip any step (partially done in Phase 14, extend to personality steps).

## For Phase 16: Agent Personality System

Concrete implementation actions:
1. **Multi-file identity architecture** — Expand from single SOUL.md to: SOUL.md (philosophy, 50-150 lines), IDENTITY.md (name/emoji/avatar/vibe), USER.md (split from MEMORY.md — static user context), STYLE.md (writing style guide), AGENTS.md (multi-agent coordination). Keep existing MEMORY.md and daily/ logs.
2. **Richer SOUL.md template** — Replace current 20-line generic template with opinionated 50-150 line template containing: Core Truths, Communication Style, Vibe, Boundaries, Continuity (self-modification instructions), Learned Preferences (existing, auto-populated).
3. **Personality evolution** — Keep tek's conservative approach (user approval required for soul changes). Add "soul evolution proposal" mechanism: agent suggests SOUL.md changes, user reviews diff-style before applying.
4. **Migration path** — Migration script reads existing SOUL.md, splits content into SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md + STYLE.md, preserves Learned Preferences verbatim. Never silently overwrite.
5. **Multi-agent identity isolation** — Per-agent workspace directories with isolated SOUL/IDENTITY/STYLE files. Shared USER.md (user context). Cascade resolution: global > per-agent > workspace > default.

## Don't Build (Anti-Patterns)

List from research — things to explicitly avoid:
- Database-backed personality system (markdown files ARE the system)
- Custom NLP pipeline for style calibration (use the LLM itself)
- Form-based personality questionnaire (use conversation-first BOOTSTRAP.md)
- Custom routing engine for multi-agent (use config-driven binding rules)
- SOUL.md over 150 lines (separate into STYLE.md / USER.md)

## Open Questions for User Decisions

Surface the 5 open questions from research as decision points for Phase 15/16 planning:
1. Should personality onboarding happen in same `tek init` session or separate `tek chat`?
2. How aggressive should personality self-evolution be?
3. How should multi-agent identities be stored (shared vs separate memory)?
4. What personality fits tek's brand for the default SOUL.md?
5. Should USER.md be split from MEMORY.md?

Include the research's recommended answers for each.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update ROADMAP.md with Phase 18 goal, success criteria, and plan list</name>
  <files>.planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Update the Phase 18 entry in ROADMAP.md:

1. Replace `**Goal:** [To be planned]` with:
   `**Goal:** Research how modern AI agent platforms handle personality, identity, and onboarding — synthesize findings into actionable recommendations for Phase 15 (Init & Onboarding Polish) and Phase 16 (Agent Personality System)`

2. Replace `**Plans:** 0 plans` with `**Plans:** 1 plan`

3. Replace `**Depends on:** Phase 17` with `**Depends on:** Phase 14` (research doesn't depend on the Tauri frontend)

4. Add requirements and success criteria:
   ```
   **Requirements**: RESEARCH-18
   **Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
     1. 18-RESEARCH.md exists with comprehensive findings on OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT personality systems
     2. 18-RECOMMENDATIONS.md exists with concrete implementation actions for Phase 15 and Phase 16
     3. Open questions surfaced with recommended answers for user decision during downstream phase planning
   ```

5. Replace the TBD plan list with:
   ```
   Plans:
   - [ ] 18-01-PLAN.md — Synthesize research into recommendations and finalize roadmap
   ```

6. Update the progress table: set Phase 18 to "1/1 | In progress"
  </action>
  <verify>grep "Goal.*Research how modern" .planning/ROADMAP.md returns a match; grep "18-01-PLAN" .planning/ROADMAP.md returns a match</verify>
  <done>ROADMAP.md Phase 18 has real goal, success criteria, requirements, dependency, and plan list — no more placeholders</done>

<success_criteria>
- 18-RECOMMENDATIONS.md is a self-contained document that Phase 15/16 planners can read WITHOUT needing to read 18-RESEARCH.md
- ROADMAP.md Phase 18 entry has no placeholder text remaining
- All research findings are distilled into specific, actionable implementation guidance
