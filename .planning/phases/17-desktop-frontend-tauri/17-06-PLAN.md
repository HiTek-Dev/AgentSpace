  <name>Task 1: Verify complete desktop application</name>
  <action>Human verifies all 5 DESK requirements in the running desktop app.</action>
  <what-built>
    Complete Tauri v2 desktop application with:
    1. Native macOS window with sidebar navigation (Dashboard, Chat, Agents, Settings)
    2. Gateway lifecycle management (discover, start, stop, status display)
    3. Chat interface with WebSocket connection, message sending, and streaming responses
    4. Agent identity file viewer/editor (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, STYLE.md)
    5. Settings page with config viewing, model alias management, and save/reload
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start the app: `cd apps/desktop && pnpm tauri dev`
    2. **Navigation:** Verify sidebar shows 4 pages, clicking each switches the view
    3. **Dashboard:** Check gateway status displays correctly. If gateway is stopped, click Start. If running, verify port/PID/uptime shown. Click Stop and confirm it stops.
    4. **Chat:** Navigate to Chat. Verify connection status. Type a message, press Enter. Confirm the message appears and streaming response comes back from the gateway.
    5. **Agents:** Navigate to Agents. Verify identity file tabs load. Click each tab. Edit a file, press Cmd+S. Verify file saved (check with `cat ~/.config/tek/SOUL.md` or similar).
    6. **Settings:** Navigate to Settings. Verify config values display. Try editing default model or adding an alias. Save and verify config.json updated.
